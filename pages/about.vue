    <p class="">In 2022 I decided to tryout for Amazon's bootcamp. While I never took the test, I was hooked after peaking behind the curtains to see how websites were made. 2023 I enrolled in a bootcamp to get a better understanding of how to build applications and learn some languages. After that was done I spent time learning and deciding on my personal stack. Currently I am attending Southern New Hampshire University </p>
